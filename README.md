# About
This is the third project for Udacity mobile flashcard work. You could manage decks and cards in it to answer questions at any time with your phone.

# How to start project
Run
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

to get ready for this App.

# Testing
Manual testings are done on IOS simulator. My local version of Iphone simulator is X - 11.2.

I personally use expo to have my local testing environment ready, it is highly recommended.
